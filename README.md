# Parser-of-Compiler-in-C
Course Name: Compiler Construction Lab
Course Code: CS-471L
University Name: **University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore**
Supervisor Name: **Mr. Laeeq Khan** 
Description: In this activity, we are implementing tokenizer and parser of the compiler in c++. We will update some features in the parser,
with the help of STL. 
The features include:
Making language errors more human friendly to display the line number of the error.
Adding more data types like float, double, string, bool, char into the language.
Adding more keywords into the language.
These are some examples, we will keep updating the code as needed.
